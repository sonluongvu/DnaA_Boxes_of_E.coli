# DnaA_Boxes_of_E.coli

Finding the location of DnaA boxes from the genome sequence of E.coli.

E.coli strain K-12, sub-strain MG1655

Steps:
- Acquire the genome sequence of E.coli.
- Create a #G-#C versus k graph.
- Determine the location for OriC of E.coli.
    - The length of OriC is 232 bp
- Finding the location of DnaA boxes.
